# Classical Chinese Lookup

This is a simple python tool to look up pronunications and definitions of classical chinese characters, usig the Baxter-Sagart *Old Chinese: A New Reconstruction* dictionary available [here](https://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/).

It takes input as *traditional* chinese characters, and will display pinyin, middle and old reconstructions, simplified, as well as definitions of all characters entered.

## Usage

Enter traditional chinese at the top. *Search* will search the dictionary for all the characters - if there is a glyph not in the dictionary (maybe a latin letter or simplified character) it will display with [square brackets] around it in all result fields.

*Clear* will clear *all* fields. 

## Notes

Make sure the dictionary csv is in the same folder as the executable.

Technically, all fields are typeable, this is solely to allow copy-paste. Search only looks at the topmost text box.
